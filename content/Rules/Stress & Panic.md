# Panic
Whenever you elect to [[Tests & Saves#Pushing a Test|push a test]], or in the case of some talents, you will gain stress. Stress can be helpful, each stress grants you an extra die on tests. Downside is when you roll a one on a stress die (even when not pushing) you must make a Panic Save. If you fail the Panic Save, you fail the test regardless of the SL rolled.
## Making a Panic Save
Roll a Panic Save as per the character sheet, looking to get SL equal to the number of 1s rolled on the stress dice.

If you succeed, reduce stress to 0 and continue the action. If you fail, roll on the following table to determine the effect:

| 2d6+stress | Panic Effect                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3          | A momentary stutter. No further effect                                                                                                                       |
| 4–5        | Deep trembles. You get -1 SL to your next roll.                                                                                                              |
| 6–7        | Your limbs go numb. Gain Stunned(1) and increase Stress by 1.                                                                                                |
| 8          | You can barely breathe. Increase Stress by 2.                                                                                                                |
| 9–10       | Scream! All allies within earshot increase stress by 1. All enemies are alerted to your presence.                                                            |
| 11         | Freeze. Gain Stunned(3). Allies within line of sight gain 1 stress.                                                                                          |
| 12         | Drop held items **or** clutch it tight and increase stress by 2                                                                                              |
| 13         | Run for cover. Your next turn must be taken running for the nearest safe place. Remove all stress if you make it.                                            |
| 14–15      | Berserk. You immediately roll to attack the nearest thing. Select randomly. Remove all stress if you connect. This attack does not benefit from stress dice. |
| 16+        | Heart attack. Reduce Wounds and Hit point to zero. Transfer all stress to allies within line of sight (player's choice) and immediately reach death's door.  |
## Reducing Stress
In the heat of combat, a character can make an Intelligence Test to think it through and reduce their stress. Alternatively an ally may attempt a Leadership test for the same effect. On a success, reduce stress to zero.

Once calmness has returned, return all stress to zero. If the party is in a stressful situation, the GM may raise the minimum stress.
