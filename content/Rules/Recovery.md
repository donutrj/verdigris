Recovering from injuries takes time. Wounds can patched and humors balanced, but it's up to the body to stitch muscles back together. While anyone can try to help the process along with a little first aid, often it's best to leave it be.
# Medical Attention
Medical attention includes, but is not limited to:
+ Successful use of the heal skill
+ Application of bandages, healing poultices, or similar
+ Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals

Any healing test used to remove bleeding conditions, applying a bandage, or drinking potions are one turn actions that can be repeated turn after turn. Such actions cannot be taken while in a melee.
## Surgery
Surgery (typically requiring the [[Talent List#Surgery|surgery talent]]) assumes you have at least a Physician's Toolkit. Any surgery used to remove bleeding conditions (with the requirement for surgery defined in the critical hit chart results) is a one turn action as well. Using surgery to prevent long-term effects, like setting a complicated fracture, will usually take an hour or more.
## Embedded Projectiles
Critical hits from projectiles will often result in the projectile remaining lodged in the character's body. The requirement for, and difficulty of, any such removal will vary by table and result. If a projectile is lodged, it will be stated as requiring Extraction(*required SL*) or that the extraction will require surgery, specified as Surgery(*required SL*). If there is added risk of infection it will also be stated.

A failed extraction test results in Bleeding (1).
## Festering Wounds
Festering wounds are open bloody injuries, prone to attracting dirt and grime. When testing for an infection, make it with a -2 penalty.
## Broken Bones
Small fractures may heal on their own accord, but severe breaks, with bone protruding at odd angles from the flesh, are a different matter entirely, If you suffer a Broken Bone, it will be marked as minor or major.
### Minor
You have fractured one of your bones, but it is still aligned, meaning it may heal of its own accord without medical attention. The Hit Location is unusable until the breakage heals.

For Arm and Leg hits, you are down to one limb as the other is too painful to use, and may require binding. Use the rules for a Severed Arm or Leg to represent this (see Amputated Parts). For Head hits you will be down to a liquid diet and will suffer a penalty of –3 to all Charisma Tests. For Body hits, your strength and mobility will be severely limited: suffer a loss of –3 to your Strength and Agility Tests.
#### Healing
A Minor broken bone will take 5d6 days to heal. Afterwards a Withstand Save is required to determine if the bone has set well, else risk long-term effects. If failed you suffer a permanent -1 to Agility for a damaged limb, -1 Strength for a damaged body, or -1 intelligence and charisma for a head wound.

A successful Healing Test within a week of receiving the fracture will negate the need for the Endurance Test, but the affected area must remain bound and held in place for the duration of the healing. If the binding should be undone, another Heal Test enacted within a day will need to be passed to avoid the Withstand Save.
### Major
One of your bones is badly broken, and is either resting at an odd angle or has splintered at the point of breakage,. It is unlikely to heal properly without medical attention. The hit location is effectively unusable until the breakage heals.
#### Healing
Use the same rules as minor breakages, but the tests require 3SL.
## Torn Muscles
Sprains or tears to your muscles or ligaments result in significant pain and possible loss of use depending upon the severity, which will be marked as minor or major.
### Minor
One of your muscles is sprained or torn, resulting in impaired capabilities and much pain. Suffer a -1 penalty to all tests involving the hit location. If a leg hit, moving in or out of melees requires a successful acrobatics test.
#### Healing
The muscle will partially heal after 3d6 days. A healing test will reduce the time by 1d6 per SL.
### Major
One of your muscles or some tendons have been severely damaged, resulting in extreme pain and a significant loss on capability of the afflicted limb.

Suffer the same effects as minor torn muscles, but the penalty is -2 to all tests.
#### Healing
The muscle will partially heal after 5d6 days, reducing the penalty to -1. After another 3d6 days it will be fully healed. Healing Tests do nothing.
## Amputated Parts
Many of the more severe Critical Wounds result in the loss of a body part, such as fingers, hands, feet, or even a whole leg! Should a character suffer more than one severed body part, it is probably time to start looking for an appropriate replacement to mitigate any possible penalties.

Whenever you suffer a Critical Wound marked Amputation (difficulty), you must pass a Withstand or Panic Save (the difficulty is marked in the brackets) or gain a Prone Condition. Failure by two or more, you also gain a Stunned Condition; or Unconscious Condition if failed by four or more.
### Arm
Use the rules for lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the arm since you don’t have one.
### Ear
Losing an ear is painful, but you will soon learn to live without it.Should you have the bad luck to lose both your ears, permanently suffer a penalty of –2 to all hearing-based Tests. Further, you suffer a penalty of –1 to all performance and persuasion Tests per ear lost when others can see your earless state.
### Eye
For all losing an eye is horrendous, but you soon learn to compensate. You suffer a penalty of -2 to all bluffing, performance and persuasion tests and gain +1 to intimidation based tests.

Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes, you are permanently blinded.
### Fingers
Losing a finger results in lessened grip, causing an increased chance of fumbling Tests using that hand. Roll a separate die for all tests involving the hand. If the result is equal to or less than the number of fingers lost on that hand, the test automatically fails.

Once four or more fingers are lost of a given hand, treat it as severed.
### Foot
All agility based tests that require your feet, most of them, and dodge saves are made with a -2 penalty per foot lost.
### Hand
You take a -2 penalty to all tests that rely on the use of two hands and you cannot wield two-handed weapons; however,  a shield can be strapped to the injured arm. Should the lost hand be your primary hand, you take a -3 penalty to weapon tests. You can spend 8xp to reduce this penalty by 1 as you relearn how to do everything with the other hand.
### Leg
Treat this  as a lost foot, but you automatically fail all dodge saves.
### Nose
A loss of a nose leaves one looking freakish in the extreme. Suffer a -3 penalty to charisma based tests and those based on scent. Intimidation tests are made at +1.
### Teeth
Loss of teeth may be unsightly and can make eating difficult. For every three teeth lost, reduce suffer a -1 to charisma based tests. If you lose half or more of your teeth you find consuming food to be difficult, doubling eating times, and making some foodstuffs nigh-on impossible to eat.
### Toes
Loss of toes has an adverse effect on your balance. For every two toes lost, suffer a -1 penalty to agility tests, dodge saves, and weapon skills.
### Tongue
Loss of a tongue leaves you grunting and humming, or relying on make-shift sign language  for communication.
# Resting
Recovering from injuries takes time. When a character spend a [[Travel#Resting|whole night resting]], they roll for 1d6 points. The result can be spent in the ways below. 
- Recover all hit points for 1 point.
- Recover all drain for 1 point.
- Recover a lost attribute point for 1 point.
- Recover all [[Conditions#Exhausted|exhausted conditions]] for 3 points.
- Recover a lost wound for 3 points
Points do not persist between rests. If a character takes a turn at watch or are otherwise partially occupied, they roll 1d3 instead.

If a character is fully occupied tending to the injured character's wounds, the recovering character rolls 2d6, keeping the better.
