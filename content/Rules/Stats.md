# Attributes
[[Tests & Saves#Tests|Attributes]] are used for tests. Often combined with skills, backgrounds, stress, and gear for bonuses.
+ **Strength**: the physical might of a character. It is used to test the force of a punch, the climbing of a rope, or when drawing the bow.
+ **Agility**: the speed and dexterity of a character. It is used to run away, pick locks, shoot crossbows and blackpowder arms.
+ **Intelligence**: the intellect of a character. It is used when casting spells, spotting tracks, and navigation.
+ **Charisma**: the social charm of a character. It is used in all kinds of social settings, uncovering lies, and pleading with gods for their blessings.
# Saves
[[Tests & Saves#Saves|Saves]] are used when something happens to a character. Whether when dodging attacks, remaining functional after a night's march, or keeping their cool.
+ **Panic**: made whenever a player rolls a 1 on their stress dice. Failure typically results on a roll on the [[Stress & Panic#Panic|panic table]].
+ **Dodge**: made when dodging an attack or avoiding danger. Failure typically results in a withstand save before damage is calculated. 
+ **Warding**: made to resist magical effects. Failure means the whims of gods and wizards alike will affect you.
+ **Withstand**: made to endure hardship. These are often made to avoid harm from blows with gear bonuses from armor, or might be made without when slogging through the swamps for the forty-eighth hour.
# Skills
If a character attempts something and they have a relevant skill, the player rolls bonus dice equal to the level of that skill during the test.

Skills are used in conjunction with attributes when making [[Tests & Saves#Tests|tests]]. They provide a bonus and are improvable by spending [[Experience#Spending Experience|xp]]. 
### Acrobatics
When jumping, climbing, balancing or performing a similar physical action, roll for this skill.
### Awareness
As an adventurer you must always be on your guard, or you won’t live long. You use your awareness skill to watch or listen for anyone sneaking around nearby (opposed roll, see sneaking below).

Groups: If multiple player characters are in the same place, each of you makes a separate awareness roll. You cannot help each other.
### Bartering
When haggling over the price of something you are buying or selling, roll for bartering. If you succeed, the price goes down or up by 20%.
### Beast Lore
The world is full of common and rare animals and beasts of all kinds. Roll for beast lore when trying to identify an animal or monster, or to know its habits, abilities, and weaknesses. If you succeed, the GM should give you some piece of useful information.
### Bluffing
To quickly come up with a convincing lie can be an invaluable skill as an adventurer. If the GM finds your bluff unconvincing, you get disadvantage on your test. If your bluff is completely unbelievable, it fails automatically – no matter how well you deliver it.
### Bushcraft
The vast wilderness is a dangerous place where wild beasts roam. The ignorant can lose their lives by choosing the wrong path through the woods or making camp in the wrong spot. Roll for bushcraft to lead the way through the wilderness, make camp, cook food, or stay warm in cold weather.
### Crafting
As an adventurer, you must often repair your gear if it breaks. Typically, it takes one shift to repair a damaged item, and you need access to the appropriate tools (pg. 78)
### Evade
Roll for this skill when trying to dodge an attack or flee from combat.
### Healing
As an adventurer there is a significant risk that you and your friends will be injured, sooner or later. That is when healing is useful – with this skill you can get fallen companions back on their feet or even save their lives.
### Hunting & Fishing
Out in the wild, you will often need to find your own food by hunting or fishing.
### Insight
Sometimes the truth of the matter is written on one's face, other times it is clearly absent from an expression. Use this to ascertain intention and assess whether you're being told a lie.
### Languages
All player characters can speak the common tongue. To understand foreign or ancient languages, roll for this skill.
### Leadership
Leadership is all about taking charge of a situation. Whether it be talking sense into your panicked allies or trying to convince a group of guards that you really are their new captain.
### Myths & Legends
When trying to remember stories of old times or distant lands, or trying to understand links to the past, roll for this skill.
### Performance
When singing a song, reading a poem, making jokes or in some other way try to amuse a crowd, roll for performance.
### Persuasion
Life as an adventurer is dangerous, but you can often reach your goals without violence, through charm, threats, or sensible reasoning. Roll for persuasion to make another person see things your way. If you succeed, you achieve your stated objective, and the NPC does what you want. However, they might demand something in return – the GM decides what that entails.

If what you are asking for requires the NPC to sacrifice or risk something important, the roll is more difficult – it becomes an opposed roll between your persuasion and the other person’s Insight. But even in this case your request must be reasonable – no NPC will agree to just anything or act entirely against their own interests, no matter how successful the roll. The GM has the final say.
### Riding
To get up on a horse and ride slowly doesn’t require a skill roll, for but for more advanced maneuvers you need to roll for riding. Special rules apply [[Combat#Mounted Combat|in combat]].
### Seamanship
Anyone can row a boat or paddle a canoe slowly, but in more challenging situations you need to roll for seamanship to steer a vessel over water. This skill can also be used for navigation.
### Sleight of Hand
When you are trying to steal something unnoticed, pick a lock, or perform any other action that requires fine motor skills, you roll sleight of hand.
### Sneaking
It is often wise to avoid combat and hide or sneak past the enemy instead. If you win, you remain undetected. It is usually a straight skill roll, but if someone is actively looking for you, you must make an opposed roll with your sneaking against the enemy’s awareness.

Note that you can only make a sneaking roll when you can actually see or hear the enemy you wish to avoid. You never use sneaking “just in case” there is an enemy nearby.
#### Group Sneaking:
If multiple player characters are sneaking around together, each person makes a separate roll. If one of you fails, the whole group is detected.
### Spot Hidden
The art of finding what’s hidden can make you rich beyond measure – or save your life. When you are looking for something concealed, you roll spot hidden. If your description of where you are searching is very precise, the GM can give you advantage or even let you succeed without a roll.

Each spot hidden roll takes roughly a stretch. You only get one attempt to look for the same thing in exactly the same place. Multiple player characters can look simultaneously.
### Swimming
All player characters can keep afloat for a short time, but for more challenging situations a roll for swimming is required.
# Backgrounds
Backgrounds are what your character was before they became an adventurer. These come into play when a character makes a test in which their past experience would convey a bonus. 

***e.g.** A character with the background wheat farmer is trying to determine if it'll rain before they reach town. That player would get a bonus for their background considering predicting the weather is important to a farmer.*
## Wounds & Hit Points
When characters take damage, they reduce their hit points (HP) by the corresponding amount. When damage is severe or their HP is reduced to zero they take a wound. [[Combat#Damage|Learn more in the combat section]]. 
# Talents
Talents are the primary way players will spend the experience their earn during the session. These are situational bonuses that dramatically impact the way the game is played. 

The trees are presented left to right, with talents further down the line available require at least one of the talents that lead to it.
