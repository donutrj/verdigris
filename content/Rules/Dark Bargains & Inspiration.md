# Dark Bargains
At times the GM may offer a dark bargain in exchange for many things. Usually this will be offered to auto-succeed a test or find some key parts for a repair. If the offered player agrees to the dark bargain, the GM will add a dark bargain to the pool. 

The GM will spend these dark bargains to inflict minor miseries upon the players. Note that these effects are not limited to the players that accepted the dark bargain initially. Typical examples might include:

- A friend of the party betrays the group
- A substantial loss of money
- Bad actors make substantial progress in their goals
- A failed roll goes from bad to worse
- An enemy’s attack hits true
# Inspiration
Whenever another character does something inspiring and the group recognizes it as such, mark that you have an inspiration on your character sheet. Whether through incredible feats of strength, fantastic roleplaying, or thinking several steps ahead, it doesn’t matter. If the group finds it impressive, mark it down.

When making a test, you may consume that inspiration to get a +1 to the roll. You can only consume one inspiration per test. You cannot store multiple inspirations per character.
