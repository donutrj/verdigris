A god's favor is a fickle thing. When you take the devotee talent you pledge yourself to a higher power. There are many of those greater who seek a deeper presence in this world but all expect servitude in exchange for power. 

Each god manifests their powers differently. When deciding to cast a blessing there are two variables to keep in mind: 

+ **The blessing's intensity:** How powerful a blessing are you trying to manifest? Would this take any substantial effort from your master? How large a target are you attempting to affect?
+ **The blessing's domain:** Is your blessing aligned with the material your god controls? Is your blessing working towards the goals of your master?

A blessing which is minor in effect and in keeping with the goals and domain of your god should be relatively effortless and simple to complete.

For example: 
+ If you worship the god of goats and you are attempting heal a sick goat with your god's energy, it should be tiny blessing and cost next to nothing. (Tiny, Aligned)
+ If you are tending to the fever of your human ally, that's not in the domain of the goat god, but the goat god is largely in support of good health and this is a partially aligned, costing 1 favor. (Tiny, Partially Aligned)
+ If you are attempting to use your master's powers to break the limb of an innocent merchant, that's very much unaligned, but a relatively small ask. That would cost 4 favor. (small, unaligned)

| Favor SL | Aligned | Partially Aligned | Unaligned |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Tiny     | 0       | 1                 | 2         |
| Small    | 1       | 2                 | 4         |
| Medium   | 2       | 4                 | ---       |
| Large    | 4       | ---               | ---       |
