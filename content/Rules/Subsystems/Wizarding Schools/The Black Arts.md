These are spells that are strictly illegal, and in most places possession of such spellbooks will result in a death sentence.
## Animate Dead
Target: 4–6

The dead are hateful, soulless things. To drag them from the ground is a sure way to burn at the stake. This spell does bind them to your will but when they find a way around your puppetry you will suffer.

A number of skeletons equal to the test’s SL rise from the ground. They will obey the words of your orders, but cannot be trusted to remain loyal.
## Baleful Polymorph
Target: 3–5

A bolt of chaos is thrown at a target. The defender makes a Dodge Save to avoid.

If the attack hits, the victim is transformed, to a creature as desired by the caster. The victim will slowly revert to their former self over the course of SL days.
## Charm Monster
Target: 1–3

SL creatures are bound to the will of the caster for SL hours. Orders antithetical to their nature cause them to break free. 

If cast at 3SL, the slavery lasts 3 days instead.
## Charm Person
Target: 3

A single humanoid must make a Warding Save; if failed, they are bound to the will of the caster. Orders antithetical to their nature cause them to break free. Lasts 10SL minutes.
## Curse
Target: 1–2

A bane to all enemies that hear.

An enemy within line-of-sight gets a -1 to all tests and saves. Lasts SL minutes.
## Disintegrate
Target: 4–5

A spell of destruction, rare and evil. 

When touched, a single target and all they carry is destroyed if they fail a warding save.
## Dreadbolt
Target: 3-5

A bolt of crimson energy leaps from the caster's fingertips with a loud snap.

A single victim is struck, filling them with utter dread. The victim's stress increases by the spell's SL. If the SL is 5, they must immediately make a [[Stress & Panic#Making a Panic Save|panic save]] after gaining stress.
## Hallucinatory Terrain
Target: 3

Creates an illusionary overlay which can hide, exaggerate or entirely change the underlying geography. At a distance, it is flawless. Dispelled with a 3SL Spot Test or when the target reaches the terrain.
## Magic Jar
Target: 200

The first step towards godhood. The first step towards lichdom. 

Magic Jar is a very polite way of phrasing the removal of one's soul from their body and puppeting it from the outside.. This allows the caster to switch bodies and even retain memories if executed well. The soul is still kept somewhere, first hypothesized as “in a jar”. Powerful entities are always on the watch for such activities, usually the spell is beneath gods proper, but lesser immortals will certainly interfere. 
## Phantasm
Target: 8–10

Another stain on the reputation of summoners at large. This spell is known as a spell for assassins, cowards, and the monstrous. Originally conceived as a way to achieve the upside of undead labor, without the risk of rebellion.

An illusionary creature is animated and given life; convincing enough to deal real damage. Those observing closely may make warding saves to disbelieve the phantasm - banishing it in doing so.
## Witchmint Tea
Target: 5–6

Cast on a cup or pot of tea.

When drunk, the drinker takes SL/2 Exhaustion, setting in after an hour. If cast at 6+ SL, the drinker makes a Warding Save. If failed, they immediately fall unconscious and gain Exhausted(1).

To be affected, one must drink at least half a cup.
