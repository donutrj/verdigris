Verdigris is heavily inspired by the late fifteenth early sixteenth centuries, where knights in heavy plate armor are slowly being beat by the might of blackpowder. That transition is still very much in motion as blackpowder arms are massively expensive and there is much inertia within the powerbrokers. 

The collapse of the empire nearly 150 years ago continues to have consequences today. When their Pantheon turned on itself, many eldest gods were lost, their servants dead. As cities burned, so did their libraries and teachings. Young gods rose up, once considered heretical, they established a sense of legitimacy. 

Now in these latter years the survivors have scattered. Where once Caledonia held a near monopoly on power, the teaching of magic and machinery have spread far. Young colleges have sprung up, new guilds have been established. Trade secrets have been spilled while others have simply found a new home.

The state system for developing powerful battlemages has been lost to time. Such an intense process necessarily created substantial human detritus. The focuses of modern education are less intensive and intrusive–resulting in less waste. Caledonia's universities, while gutted, still exist. Many still study there, as professors try to reclaim lost knowledge. 

The land is littered with petty kings. Leveraging a mix of mercenary troops and local armies, they war. Some ape the past, seeking to reclaim and rebuild the glory of old while others reject it, looking to the future.
