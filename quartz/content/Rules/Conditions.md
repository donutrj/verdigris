Conditions represent the effects of things that can happen to you in the course of your adventures. Each Condition explains how long any effects usually last in its description; however, it’s possible the cause of a Condition—such as a spell or critical wound—may override this.
# Multiple Conditions
You can be subject to the same Condition more than once; indeed, sometimes you will receive multiples of the same Condition from a single event. If this occurs, any penalties suffered are stacked. So, if you have three Bleeding Conditions, you’re losing a worrying 3 Wounds per Round; or if you have 3 Exhausted Conditions, you suffer –30 to all Tests. You can also be subject to multiple, different Conditions at once.
# Master Condition List
## Ablaze
You're on fire!

At the start of each of your turns, suffer 1d6 damage, reduced by the SL of an armor save, taking a minimum of 1 damage. Additionally suffer -1 to all panic saves. Each extra ablaze condition increases the damage & panic penalty by 1, so having three ablaze conditions would result in 1d6+2 damage, with a minimum of 1.

Ablaze conditions can be removed with a successful acrobatics test, with each SL removing one condition. The test will be modified by the surroundings; it’s much easier to put out a fire rolling around on sand than it is in the middle of an oil-soaked kitchen.
## Bleeding
You are bleeding badly.

Lose 1d3 hp at the start of each of your turns. Further, suffer a -1d penalty to resist festering wounds and infections.

A bleeding condition can be removed with a successful heal test, with each SL removing an extra bleeding condition; or with any spell or prayer that heals wounds, with one condition removed per 3hp healed.

Once all bleeding conditions are removed, pass a withstand save or immediately gain the Exhausted condition

Should bleeding reduce your hp to 0, instead of rolling for a critical injury, gain the Unconscious condition. Each subsequent turn you take without an ally performing a successful healing test to stabilize the wound, risks your death. Make a withstand save, you need SL equal to the number of Bleeding conditions to avoid death.
## Blinded
Whether from a flash of light, utter darkness, or liquid in the eyes; you cannot see clearly.

You suffer -1 to all rolls requiring sight (most of them) and enemies gain +1 to their attacks.

One Blinded condition is removed at the start of every other turn.
## Broken
You are terrified, defeated, panicked, or otherwise convinced you are going to die.

On your turn, you must pass a Panic Save else spend your Move and Action to run away as fast as possible until you are in a good hiding place beyond the sight of any enemy. You also receive a cumulative -1 penalty to all Tests not involving running and hiding.

If you spend a full Round in hiding out of line-of-sight of any enemy, you remove 1 Broken Condition. Once all Broken Conditions are removed, gain 1 Exhausted Condition.
## Deafened
Whether caused by a loud noise or a blow to the head, you are unable to hear properly.

You suffer a –1 penalty to all Tests involving hearing, and opponents attacking you in melee double their benefit from outnumbering you. (this bonus does not increase with multiple Deafened Conditions).

One Deafened Condition is removed at the end of every other Round.
## Entangled
You are wrapped in something restricting your movement; it could be ropes, spider’s webbing, or an opponent’s bulging biceps.

	On your turn, you may not Move, and all your actions involving movement of any kind suffer a penalty of –1 (including Grappling). For your Action, you can remove an Entangled Condition with an opposed Brawling Test against the source of the entanglement, with each SL removing an extra Entangled Condition.
## Exhausted
You are fatigued and in desperate need of rest.

You suffer a -1 to all Tests and Saves. Removing Exhausted conditions is accomplished through [[Combat#Resting|rest]].
## Poisoned
You have been poisoned or injected with venom.

All Tests to remove poison have their difficulty determined by the poison or venom suffered. At the end of each Round, lose 1 hit point, ignoring all modifiers. Also, suffer a penalty of –1 to all Tests and Withstand Saves.

If you reach 0 Hit Points while Poisoned, you cannot heal until all Poisoned Conditions are removed. If you fall Unconscious while Poisoned, make an Withstand Save after a number of Rounds equal to your Strength or die horribly.

At the end of each Round, you may attempt a Withstand Save. If successful, remove a Poisoned Condition, with additional SL removing extra Poisoned Conditions. A Healing Test provides the same results. Once all Poisoned Conditions are removed, gain 1 Exhausted Condition.
## Prone
You have fallen to the ground, possibly because you’ve tripped, or because you’ve been hit by something rather large.

On your turn you can spend your action to stand up. Enemies attacking you in melee gain +2 to hit.

Unlike most other conditions, Prone does not stack — you are either Prone, or you are not. You lose the Prone Condition when you stand up.
## Stunned
You have been struck about the head or otherwise disorientated or confused; your ears are likely ringing, and little makes sense.

When you gain the stunned condition, pass a Withstand Save, SL equal to the number of Stunned Conditions else fall prone. While stunned you make all tests and saves at a cumulative -1 and are incapable of spellcasting. 

At the start of your turn you may attempt a Withstand Save, with each SL removing a Stunned Condition. Once all stunned conditions are removed, gain a Exhausted condition if you don't already have one.
