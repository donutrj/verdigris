## Cindersteel Resin
A pale amber resin that hardens instantly when exposed to flame. Applied to fabrics like wax, it prevents them from catching fire, though renders the cloth too stiff for ordinary wearing.
## Dreamwalker's Brew
A rust-colored potion. When boiled in a confined space, the vapor leaves the room and those in it unnaturally muffled. 
## Gravefire Cordial
A syrupy blue liquid that tastes of almonds gone bad. When drunk it dulls the mind to pain, allowing them to ignore some effects of [[Recovery#Torn Muscles|torn muscles]] and [[Recovery#Broken Bones|broken bones]].

Often leads to the injuries worsening as the body's pleads are ignored. 
## Kaelen's Blasting Grease
A glossy brown oil that roughens the skin on contact and adheres strongly to metal. When struck by sudden force, it reacts violently, transforming into a thick, opaque gas that leaves a bitter taste in the air.

If applied to a blunt weapon, it deals an extra 1d6 damage and reduces the weapon's quality by 1d3.
## Sun-Doused Oil
A viscous, golden oil that accentuates the ringing of metals it is applied to. When applied to an arrow or blade, it causes the weapon to pop and fizzle with a blinding light for a moment on impact, requiring those in melee to pass a withstand save or gain [[Conditions#Blinded|Blinded(1)]].

Leaves small burns.
## Thirsting Powder
A dusty grey powder that devours liquids upon contact, absorbing liquids many times its size and weight within seconds. The reaction generates intense heat, often causing burns to surfaces it touches.

When fully saturated, an immensely dense paste forms, which remains hot to the touch for hours. 
## Wailing Wax
A hard red-grey wax that, when melted, releases an inhuman scream. Those without alchemical skills must pass an awareness test or else consider it human. 

Dogs know it isn't from a living creature on instinct.
