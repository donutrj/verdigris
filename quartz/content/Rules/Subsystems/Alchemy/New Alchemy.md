Alchemy is the science of distilling the properties of natural materials into practical products. These range from simple ointments and antidotes to volatile explosives and deadly poisons.

Unlike magic, alchemy doesn't harness thaumic currents; instead, it relies on manipulating inherent qualities within matter itself. Consequently, alchemical processes are undetectable as magical energies.
## Alchemical Reagents
Natural materials possess a wide array of properties related to their function. Alchemical reagents are these materials refined â€“ unnecessary components dissolved away to isolate specific qualities. Reagents can be derived from minerals, plants, and animals.

When an alchemist brews, they combine reagents to create an alchemical product.
### Essences
Unlike alchemical reagents, which are broadly applicable and reasonably shelf stable when kept under proper conditions, essences are ephemeral ingredients suited to a specific purpose. These require skills beyond the typical alchemist and only made for specific purposes.
## Brewing
In order to brew, a alchemist must have ready access to:
+ Alchemist tools
+ Clean water & a fire
+ [[Activities#The Standard Day|A shift's time]], uninterrupted

If the above are met, the alchemist can brew one alchemical product or refine an appropriate material into an alchemical reagent.
## Alchemical Products
Alchemical Products are the final creations of the alchemist. These are the potions and powders you think of when you think of alchemy. Each product has a recipe, which the alchemist keeps in their cookbook.
