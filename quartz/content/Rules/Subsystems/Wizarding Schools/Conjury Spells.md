## Amber Shell
Target: 2 

The caster exudes a syrupy resin that hardens into translucent amber, encasing an object or creature the caster touches.

The amber has 2SL hit points, which must be broken before damaging what is underneath. If used on a creature, it gains [[Conditions#Entangled|entangled]] conditions equal to the spell's SL.

The amber lasts for 1 hour, slowly crumbling afterwards.
## Barnlight
Target: 2+

Barnlight has long been used as a way to provide long-term lighting to areas especially prone to fires. It is a particularly flexible spell where overcasting can be channeled into more light rather than resulting in miscasts.

An area is permanently lit by a gentle light. Overcasting results in a brighter light. Note that barnlights grow colder the more overcast the spell. 

4+ SL results in a bright light. 8+ SL results in a blinding light. 
## Brass Nest
Target: 4–5

The caster conjures a twisted structure of woven metal, warm to the touch and sealed against the elements.

A shelter forms, large enough to hold up to SL people. The interior is dry, windproof, and mildly warm. It collapses back to the earth after 12 hours.

Can be cast as a reaction, with a target of 2. If cast in the manner it fits only one person and dissolves after an hour.
## Cloudkill
Target: 2–4`

The caster exhales a heavier-than-air cloud large enough to fill a small room. It smells of whatever the caster last ate.

Those caught in the cloud cannot breathe and are considered drowning. Should one breathe the cloud they take 2SL damage minus the SL of a warding save. The cloud lingers for 20 minutes after which it will dissipate. 
## Color Spray
Target: 2–3

Alien colors burst from the caster’s eyes, spraying those around them.

The target, either an individual or all those within a melee, gain SL [[Conditions#Blinded|blinded]] conditions.
## Dimension Door
Target: 2–3

The caster uses a traditionally sappy chalk to draw a portal, moving through it to another point within line of sight. Attempting to draw the portal on grass or similarly uneven surfaces results in an automatic -1 SL on the Cast Test.

The caster can teleport to another point within line of sight by going through the drawn portal. The portal collapses after SL beings have passed through. If drawn around the feet of the caster (or other creature) they fall through and are knocked [[Conditions#Prone|prone]] as they reach the other side.
## Fogbank
Target: 2–5

Used by many battlemages to obscure troop movements and many hedge-witches to shelter crops from the heat of summer. Can be cleared by strong wind. 

Over the course of several minutes a dense fog spreads from the caster, eventually reaching the size of a large field, obscuring the area. The fog lasts 30 minutes in direct sunlight but can last consecutive days in naturally foggy environments. 
## Gust
Target: 1–2

As magic is channeled through the sweeping arms of the caster, it transforms into a strong wind capable of knocking things aside. A common spell for a ship's mage. 

A target must make a Dodge Save meeting the spell’s SL to avoid being knocked prone. Can be used to extinguish torches or other lights. Not typically lethal, but should the target be patrolling a wall or near the edge of a ship, their life might be in peril. 
## Horsbraile’s Needle of Thaum
Target: 2–3

Cast in reaction to another spell going off, doing so is a reaction and will forfeit your next turn in combat

Summons a silver-blue needle that shoots towards the opposing caster’s work, piercing it and releasing a number of white pigeons equal to the SL of the two spells combined.
## Rainfall
Target: 3–5

A clearly useful spell. Heavily utilized for both warfare and agriculture, rainfall can produce light drizzling over large areas or intense downpours in localized areas. If the land is naturally raining, the spell amplifies the effect, resulting in a debilitating torrent.

An area within the caster’s line of sight suffers rain. Concentrated in a compact area, such as a farmer’s field or the space around a building results in a heavy downpour, obscuring vision and creating noise. If already storming, the spell can amplify the rain to a degree causing minor damage, dealing 1 damage to those caught in it for every 5 minutes.

The spell sustains for 10 minutes.
## Soundglass
Target: 1–3

Crystallizes ambient noise into fragile, translucent shards. Takes 10 minutes to cast.

Each shard “stores” a specific loud sound made during the casting—shouting, footsteps, etc.

Throwing or breaking a shard releases the captured sound. It can be used to cause distractions, mimic presence, or cover movement.

Up to SL shards may be created. They last 24 hours or until used.
