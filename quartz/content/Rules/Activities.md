Activities are the various ways you can spend your day. This is not an exhaustive list, but as the campaign has gone on, I want a place to collect all the things that work.
# The Standard Day
The standard day is broken into three shifts; Morning, Evening, and Night. During each shift, a character can perform an activity. Some activities can overlap, such as resting for the portion of the night, and keeping watch for the other part. In cases like these, some adjustments are listed.
# Activities
The following is a non-exhaustive list of various activities characters can get up to throughout the day. Each will be gone into further below.

| Activity       | Effect                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brewing        | Used to make potions.                                                           |
| Foraging       | Foraging is used when searching for food or looking for alchemical ingredients. |

| Marching       | Spending the day on the move. Speed can be varied for different affects.        |
| Repairing Gear |                                                                                 |
| Resting        | Gain 1d6 recovery dice. See [[Recovery]] for more.                              |
| Scouting       | One or a group may venture ahead to see what's in the surrounding area.         |
| Studying       | Wizard and library stuff                                                        |
| Wound Tending  | Actively caring for someone to speed their recovery or tend to critical wounds. |
## Brewing
Spend time reducing ingredients into reagents and reagents into potions. Learn more about brewing [[New Alchemy|here]]. 
## Foraging
Spending the time looking for animals, roots, alchemical ingredients, etc. The following table assumes the character is looking for food, representing bonuses to the intelligence test - with each success granting a day's ration.

If spending the shift fishing at a viable water, gain +1 to the test. Foraging at night imparts -2 to the test.

The [[Penny Talents#Hunter's Eye|hunter's eye]] and [[Penny Talents#Fisherman|fisherman]] talents supplant this system. 

| Foraging Bonus | Barren | Sparse | Thriving | Verdent |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Storming       | -3     | -2     | -1       | 0       |
| Rain / Ice     | -2     | -1     | +1       | +2      |
| Clear          | -1     | 0      | +2       | +3      |
## Keeping Watch
You can split this with resting, allow for two characters to catch a little bit of rest as [[Recovery#Resting|outlined here]]. When keeping watch, roll an awareness test. If resting at night (the norm) the awareness test is made with a -1 penalty.

A character cannot tend wounds and keep watch at the same time.

If you succeed you'll at least see them coming.
## Marching
Marching is how the group will spend much of their travels. A comfortable pace on decent ground does not require any kind of test. Pace, animas, stealth, duration, and difficult terrain / weather will all add some challenge to traveling. 
## Repairing Gear
## Resting
This is the typical nighttime action, where the party sleeps off the day's struggle. This allows the players to roll their 1d6 as per [[Recovery#resting|resting]]. 
## Wound Tending
By spending a shift tending to someone recovering from their wounds, they roll 2d6 and take the better in their recovery. You can only aid one person per shift, unless you have the [[Talent List#Triage Expert|Triage Expert]] talent.
