# Turn Order
Combat is broken down into rounds, each consisting of a collection of turns, one per participant. At the beginning of each round, a player rolls a d6 for the party. On a 4+ the players have won the initiative.

Turns are taken in one at a time, alternating between players/allies and enemies. If players won the initiative this round, they go first. A character is chosen, and they take a turn. After which an enemy takes a turn. This goes back and forth until everything has taken a turn, then a new round begins with the next player rolling another d6. 
## Surprise
In instances when surprise occurs, the surprising party takes all turns before the surprised side acts. Then resume normal round/turn order afterwards.

Avoiding surprise is outlined in skills here.
# Actions
On their turn, a character can move and take an action. That action can be to move again.
## Movement & Range
Space in Verdigris is abstracted to zones. A character can use their movement to get between zones and enter or exit a melee. 

For the purpose of ranged combat, battles consist within the range of weapons. Penalties can be awarded for attempting long shots, shooting into cover, etc..
## Attacking & Defending
To attack, a player makes a test (strength for melee & bows, agility for crossbows and blackpowder) opposed by the defender's dodge save. If the attacker gets more SL than the defender, the attack connects. 

The defender must then make a withstand save, adding gear dice for their armor. Each success reduces the damage of the attack by one. 
### Melees
A melee happens when two or more foes are within striking distance. Anyone in a melee can attack on their turn and try to stop others from getting away. There’s no limit to how many can be involved.

If one side outnumbers the other, they roll extra dice when they attack—one bonus die per extra fighter.

Getting out of a melee takes an Agility test. One enemy can try to hit you as you leave, but no matter the outcome, a passed test means you’re out.
### Ranged Combat
To make a ranged attack, roll using the appropriate skill (bows, crossbows, etc.). The target defends with a Dodge save.

If the target is caught in a melee, the shot takes a –1 penalty for every participant beyond four. If the attack misses with exactly 0 SL, it hits someone else instead—roll randomly to see who.

Shields help against ranged attacks (except blackpowder weapons), giving +1 to the defender’s Dodge save.
#### Called Shots
In the event you'd like to target a specific area of an enemy, such as the head or legs, this is a called shot. Called shots are more challenging, but if you manage to hit, they can have unique effects.

If you're targeting the head, or other weak spot; seeking to deal a greater amount of damage, it deals the weapon's maximum damage on hit. If you're seeking an alternative affect, such as knocking the weapon out of an enemy's hand or shooting them in the legs to make them trip, the attack does no extra damage. Work with the GM on the affect.

To make a called shot, just roll your skill, weapon and stress dice. Your opponent makes a Dodge Save as normal.
### Mounted Combat
Mounts act on the same turn as their rider. Unless trained for battle, a mount’s instinct is to flee from danger. To get a mount to do something outside its training, make a Charisma/Riding test.
+ In melee, a mount will attack threats using its Quality + Bonus, like a player would. This roll can’t be pushed.
+ Riders gain +1 to melee tests while mounted, as long as their weapon doesn’t have the Short quality.
+ Ranged weapons can’t be fired or reloaded from horseback unless the rider has the proper talents.
+ When attacking a mounted target, you can choose to strike the rider or the mount. The rider defends with a Dodge save as usual.
+ Mounts don’t count toward numerical advantage in melees.
### Attacks of Opportunity
Free attacks (also called opportunity attacks) can happen when a character leaves a melee—but there are other cases too.

Some examples:
+ A fighter readies a bow, waiting to shoot the first enemy through a door.
+ A guard watches an exit, striking at anyone who tries to dash past.
+ Moving through a space controlled by enemies without caution or cover.

These attacks are usually triggered by risky movement or a declared reaction. The GM decides when the conditions are met.
### Critical Hits
When a player rolls four or more sixes on an attack roll, it counts as a critical hit and deals double the weapon’s listed damage. If an enemy lands a critical hit against you, you take the normal damage and must also roll for a [[Critical Injuries|critical injury]].
### Grappling
Subduing an enemy through grapple is a tradition as old as limbs. With empty hands, you can attempt a Brawling Test versus the opponent's Dodge Save. Should you succeed, you gain one [[Conditions#Entangled|entangled]] conditions, and your foe gains two. On your turn you may break the grapple as a free action. Should your opponent remove the entangled conditions, they can choose to break the grapple, freeing themselves, or grapple you, giving you two entangled conditions.
# Damage
Damage reduces a character’s hit points. When an enemy drops to 0 HP, they are slain.

When a player character drops to 0 HP, reduce their Wounds by one, restore HP to full, and roll on the [[Critical Injuries]] table.

If a player character reaches 0 HP and has no Wounds remaining, they are at Death’s Door.
## Death’s Door
When a character reaches zero wounds and hit points, they are on Death’s Door. Once a minute or on their turn in combat, make a withstand save. On a fail, the character is dead. 
## Weapon Damage
A [[Arms & Armor#Weapons|weapon’s table entry]] will have a damage and bonus listed. When a target is struck, reduce the target’s hit points equal to the damage value + 1 for each SL. 
# Inventory Management
A character can access items on their belt once on their turn as a free action, whereas getting an item from their pack is an action.
