*(Injury tables stolen from WFRP 4e) Considering using [these tables](https://www.windsofchaos.com/?page_id=19) for specific damage types tbh. Lemme know what yall think. I would adjust the effects to this system but dear god I am short on time these days.*

When a critical injury is called for, follow the procedure below

First, roll for hit location using the table below

| d6  | Location |
| --- | -------- |
| 1   | Head     |
| 2   | Body     |
| 3-4 | Arms     |
| 5-6 | Legs     |
Second, all allies able to witness the injury make a [[Tests & Saves#Saves|panic save]]. If they fail, they gain 1d3 stress.

Third, roll on the corresponding table based on the location and type of injury.
