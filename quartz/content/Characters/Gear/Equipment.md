# Inventory
A character’s inventory is split between three spaces: hands, belt, and pack. Each space uses slots to roughly denote the amount they can hold. One slot can hold roughly a dozen eggs, but is more an idea than a hard rule.

| Items   | Size                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ammo    | Ammo can be stored in bundles of six                                                                                             |
| Armor   | A number of slots equal to it's impeding, while not less than one                                                                |
| Books   | Books take up a slot each                                                                                                        |
| Clothes | A day's clothes equals one slot, more elaborate attire will require more space                                                   |
| Coinage | Coins can be grouped into sacks of 60 per slot. Loose change and other coin sized objects can be grouped together into one slot. |
| Potions | One slot                                                                                                                         |
| Rations | Three per slot                                                                                                                   |
| Shields | Cannot be stored on belt, one slot                                                                                               |
| Weapons | Two-handed weapons take up two slots, otherwise one slot                                                                         |
## Hands
Hands are what characters actively hold. There are two slots, each for one hand. If weapons are held here, they are considered drawn, and people will be hostile.
## Belt
A character’s belt is where you’d stash your weapon, ammo, and other rapidly accessible items.
## Pack
A character’s pack is where they keep bulk items that don’t need to be accessed in the heat of the moment. A pack is equal to character's [[Stats#Attributes|strength]] + 4.
# Coinage
Merchants operate on the silver system, with gold and copper also being in common circulation. The standard exchange rate is 12 copper to a silver, and 20 silver to a gold.
# Selling Goods
When selling goods to merchants, players typically receive half the listed value. At GM discretion, players may make a single Bartering Test to haggle. If successful, the merchant will pay an additional 20%.
# Cost of Living
Use the following table when determining a PC's lifestyle between adventures. A social level's monthly cost of living is also a good guideline for bribes and gifts for someone of that class.
