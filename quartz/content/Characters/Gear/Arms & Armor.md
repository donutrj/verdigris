# Armor
Armor is used for Withstand Saves, providing a gear bonus in relevant situations. When pushed, ones represent the armor's degradation.

Importantly, armor does not help with blackpowder weapons.
## Impeding
Some armors are impeding, imposing difficulty on stealth and movement related tests and saves. This is typically felt in Dodge Saves.

## Blackpowder Weapons
Blackpowder weapons are complicated & fickle. They rely on a delicate trigger mechanism which is hand-fit to each weapon.

All but the very newest weapons are matchlocks, requiring a smoldering matchcord to be ready at all times. **If the cord isn't lit before combat, the user must spend an action readying the match before it can be fired.**

Even with all the faults, the effects of powder cannot be denied.

Blackpowder weapons ignore armor and cause the shooter and those adjacent to them to receive one [[Conditions#Deafened|deafened condition]].
