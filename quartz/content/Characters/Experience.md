# Gaining Experience
Life as an adventurer brings many challenges and if you survive you can be certain you will change and maybe even learn a thing or two along the way.

The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP.

- Did you participate in the game?
- Did you push a roll?
- Did you make progress toward your ambitions?
- Did your personality influence your actions?
- Did you defeat one or more enemies or acquire treasure?
- Did you panic? (fail a cool test)
- Did you overcome panic? (pass a cool test)
- Did you risk your life for another player character?
- Did you accept a dark bargain or was one (or more) used against you?
- Did you perform an extraordinary action of some kind? 

The GM has final word when it comes to how much XP each character should get. Write down the XP on your character sheet.
# Spending Experience
## Attributes
Increasing an attribute depends on it's current maximum. The cost is equal to (5 * Current Max). 
## Saves
Similar to attributes, cost depends on current maximums. The cost is equal to (5 * Current Max). 
## Skills
At the cost of 6xp, you may roll 1d6. Should the result be greater than your current skill bonus, increase it by one.
## Talents
Talents are broken into [[Talent List|trees]], and as long as you have one of the former talents, you can add new talents to your pool. Some talents can be taken multiple times.

As you take talents further down the tree, they cost more. All tree are broken into five tiers, See the table below for their cost:

| Tier | Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1    | 10   |
| 2    | 12   |
| 3    | 15   |
| 4    | 20   |
| 5    | 30   |
